## Background & Objectives

In this challenge, you'll need to write **loops**, **conditions** and play with **numbers**.

Let's familiarise with JavaScript's syntax.

## Specs

Open the `lib/sum_of_negative.js`. Implement the `sumOfNegative` function which takes one `numbers` parameter (of type `Array`) and returns a `Number`: the sum of negative numbers in the array. For example:

- `sumOfNegative([-1, 4, -2, 9, 18])` should return `-3`
- `sumOfNegative([15, 16, 17, 1000])` should return `0`

👨‍🏫 Remember when TAs told you to "learn by and testing?" That meant that you should call the method with your own test arguments.

Just call your method below its definition, like this:

```js
sumOfNegative([-4, 5, -2, 9]);
```

If your code works, you should see `-6`. If you want to see results in between steps, add `console.log` statements in the `sumOfNegative` function to debug your code.
